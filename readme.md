or how not to create a Twine game in a weekend

## Game ##
Myself and [spanglypants](http://spanglypants-mcfuckyou.tumblr.com/) from Tumblr built this game this past weekend as part of a [Game Jam](http://www.electricopolis.net/2013/03/29/pphs-jam/).  In that respect it went fairly well.

I think I don't quite understand some of the things that Twine expects, however, and so that led to some funky code, and the entire battle system of this game being written in a separate file (resources/battle.js) because it feels like it just would have been pretty insane to write it inside Twine proper.

Still, it works with Sugarcane + jQuery + a script import of that file (resources/battle.js)

I'll try to get the rest of the resources included in case anyone wants to pull this and build something based upon it.  Why?  I have no idea.

Save yourself!  But maybe the code isn't as bad as I think it is.

Or maybe it's worse.

Either way, consider yourself warned.
